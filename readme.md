# Dungeon Finder
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amuroBosetti/dungeonFinder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amuroBosetti/dungeonFinder)

Welcome to my project from Colt Steele's [Web Development Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). It is based on YelpCamp, the official final project, but I wanted to make it a little more... geeky ;)

### Features
Everyone can create a user, log in and submit a dungeon, with a picture, a description and  a range of leves (remember these are Dungeons & Dragons dungeons, so you must warn people about their difficulty). Users can also comment on each other's dungeons. More features are in the oven!
### Technology
The following technologies were used to make the website:
#### Front-end
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript (duh)
* Bootstrap 4

#### Back-end
* NodeJS - Express
* MongoDB - Mongoose
* Passport for user auth

#### Testing and Deployment
* Mocha
* Sinon
* Heroku
